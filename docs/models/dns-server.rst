dns-server.yang
===============

This module was originally created by the folks at `CZNIC <nic.cz>`__ to have a basic authoritative DNS Server YANG model.
It is somewhat opinionated towards knot-dns, but is being actively worked on in this project.

One of the first things that was added are the rr-set and rr definitions.
